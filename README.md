# PhotoshopAnimationExporter
A photoshop script for exporting animations as layers to their seperate frames. Specifically useful with projects that have multiple animations seperated by folders, like so:

2. Open photoshop document
3. File>Scripts>Animation Exporter
4. Wait to complete, you will find your frames as PNG files in folders next to where your document is saved

Add a layer called "pivot" with a single pixel to set the pivot point - good for importing to Unity!
